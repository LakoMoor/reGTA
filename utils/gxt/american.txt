[MOB_01A]
Awright me ol'china! It's Paul. I might have a little result for you, but I need to speak to you in person.

[MOB_01B]
I'm enjoying a little R&R at the Club Malibu.

[MOB_01C]
Reckon you're gonna owe me a favor or two after this, sunshine. I'll see you later.

[MOB_02A]
Ssssnniiiiffffff Hey! Hello, Tommy? Tommy!

[MOB_02B]
We got a situation over at the Print Works. You better go and check it out.

[MOB_02C]
Some kind of mess or other. Things are messed up. I gotta go.

[MOB_03A]
Mr. Vercetti? I have here a signed piece of crap stating

[MOB_03B]
that you have taken on all of BJ's Auto's debts.

[MOB_03C]
With BJ's sudden disappearance I have no choice

[MOB_03D]
but to hold you responsible for his financial insecurities.

[MOB_03E]
Until this account is settled in full

[MOB_03F]
you should consider Vice City's streets to be very unfriendly.

[MOB_04A]
How you doin' mate? It's Paulo again.

[MOB_04B]
Look Tommy, I forgot to mention we're going to need some extra muscle for the concert. A bit of security.

[MOB_04C]
There's a biker gang led by Mitch Baker, it would be great publicity. Very rock and roll, baby.

[MOB_04D]
Sort this out for me and I'll get you some back stage passes for the gig, awright?

[MOB_05A]
Hey, it's Mitch. You did good Tommy, it's good to have the old girl back.

[MOB_05B]
You tell Kent Paul he'll get his security for the gig.

[MOB_05C]
You have my word on that.

[MOB_05D]
Now keep yourself out of trouble.

[MOB_06A]
Tommy, 'nuf dead man been chattin' about you, my dear.

[MOB_06B]
Thought you might need something to make you feel better. So Auntie Poulet make you some stew, aye?

[MOB_06C]
Come by me kitchen some time, ok Tommy?

[MOB_08A]
Hey Tommy, I thought you might need some business advice.

[MOB_08B]
Once you got an operation up and running, you'll need to drop by and take the week's cash.

[MOB_08C]
Let the guys think they got the run of the place and they'll try shaving the profits - ok?

[MOB_08D]
Hey, I know how to handle business, Ken, ok?

[MOB_08E]
Ok, ok. I know, you know. I know. I was,

[MOB_08F]
I was just, you know, telling you I know, that you know, that I know.

[MOB_08G]
Just keeping it sharp baby!

[MOB_08H]
Whatever, Ken, whatever...

[MOB_09A]
Hey Leo! I got some work for you!

[MOB_09B]
This ain't Leo.

[MOB_09C]
Hey, if Leo knows you got his phone, he gonna kill you!

[MOB_09E]
You killed Leo? You must have big cojones - wanna work for me?!

[MOB_09F]
Drop by my father's cafe in Little Havana and we'll talk mano a mano.

[MOB_10A]
Tommy! Look, I gotta ask you a favor.

[MOB_10B]
Steve! How's filming going!

[MOB_10C]
Fine, fine. I, heh, WE need a car chase scene, but our budget can't stretch to it.

[MOB_10D]
I've left some wheels around town. You'll know what to do.

[MOB_10E]
Ok Steve, I'll keep an eye out. Catch you later.

[MOB_11A]
Howdy son, just thought I'd ring you up and give you some advice.

[MOB_11B]
Hey, Avery. What's eating you?

[MOB_11C]
There's a lot of opportunity in this town if you own the right real estate, you catch my drift?

[MOB_11D]
I reckon so...

[MOB_11E]
All I'm saying is keep your eyes open and you might find the perfect business opportunity. I'll catch y'later.

[MOB_11F]
Later, Avery.

[MOB12_A]
Hey Tommy, it's Avery! Now listen, I got me all tied up at the moment

[MOB12_B]
and I have a representative of mine needs chaperoning out to the Gator Keys.

[MOB12_C]
I'm after some land out that way, so I'm sending someone out to sweeten the deal.

[MOB12_D]
Could you do me a favor and make sure he gets there ok?

[MOB12_E]
Yeah, sure thing Avery. Where'd you want me to pick him up?

[MOB12_F]
He's just finishing some business at the building site. I said you'd pick him up from there.

[MOB12_G]
No problem. See you later, Avery.

[MOB13_A]
Vercetti? VERCETTI!! Damn you man, you've got to help me!

[MOB13_B]
Mr. Moffat? How's family life?

[MOB13_C]
Damn you to hell, HELL, do hear me?!

[MOB13_D]
Well it was nice chatting...

[MOB13_E]
WAIT! Wait, Vercetti - Tommy, can I call you Tommy?

[MOB13_F]
We're both businessmen, yeah? You know a good deal when you hear one, ok?

[MOB13_G]
I don't have time to chat, get to the point.

[MOB13_H]
MONEY. Money is the goddamned point.

[MOB13_I]
I've escaped the coop again, but it's never long before they track me down - they think it's a damned game!

[MOB13_J]
I'm at a pay phone somewhere in this god forsaken shit hole.

[MOB13_K]
Get me out of here before they take me back and...and..oh go-o-od...

[MOB13_L]
Well, I'm busy for the next -

[MOB13_M]
No! Don't shit with me here, have a heart! No man should have to do such, such things.

[MOB13_N]
I'm on my knees here Tommy, in the dirt begging you please...

[MOB13_O]
I guess I could swing by that way, see if I can spot you...

[MOB13_P]
Oh god, they're coming. For the love of Christ hurry, hurry!

[MOB_14A]
Hey there Tommy, you're gonna love me mate.

[MOB_14B]
A little birdy told me that Vice City SWAT Division has a deposit box at a certain rather large banking establishment,

[MOB_14C]
where they keep all the bribes they've taken over the years,

[MOB_14D]
like some kind of old boys' retirement fund.

[MOB_14E]
Of course, if this information should ever help you acquire any of that cash,

[MOB_14F]
I guess you'd feel obliged to push some of it my way?

[MOB_14G]
I'll bear that in mind, thanks Kent.

[MOB_14H]
It's Paul. I'm from Kent, near London, you prat.

[MOB_14I]
My provincial English geography ain't what it was.

[MOB15_A]
Tommy, mate, it's Paul, from Kent,

[MOB15_B]
a couple of proper sorts have your name written all over them, down at the Malibu.

[MOB15_C]
What are you talking about?

[MOB15_D]
Sorts. Birds. You know. Girls. Tastey ones, don't think they're brasses or nothing.

[MOB15_E]
You gotta come check them out.

[MOB16_A]
Tommy, Paulo here, que pasa amigo?

[MOB16_B]
What do you want Paul. I don't want any fake label clothes.

[MOB16_C]
Very funny, mate, but you know I don't touch bent gear.

[MOB16_D]
Nah, I was just calling to see if I get a part in one your movies,

[MOB16_E]
back in England I did a lot of blue stuff, mate.

[MOB16_F]
I'm packing more heat than you, my son.

[MOB16_G]
Paul, thanks for the offer, I'll bear it in mind.

[MOB16_H]
Seriously, don't forget about me, after all I done for you.

[MOB16_I]
That's what I'm trying to forget about.

[MOB19_A]
Tommy V, It's KP here. Kent Paul. Word on the street is people want to rip you off.

[MOB19_B]
Keep your eye's peeled, my son. And remember, I didn't say nothing to you about this.

[MOB_20A]
Alright, Tommy, it's Paul. I just heard from a mush that you've been a real naughty boy.

[MOB_20B]
Somebody has taken offense to you acting like the big guy all of a sudden, giving it the big shot thing.

[MOB_20C]
Well, don't say I never warned you or nothing. Boasting is a mug's game, son.

[MOB_20D]
Anyway, I heard there's some price been put on your head and someone's going to have a crack at you,

[MOB_20E]
so watch yourself, and remember me, mate.

[MOB21_A]
Tommy, Thomas, it's Cortez. Que pasa?

[MOB21_B]
Things are interesting. How are you, my friend?

[MOB21_G]
I wanted to ask you about Mercedes.

[MOB21_H]
Ok, what about her?

[MOB21_I]
Oh Tommy, Tommy. I, I hear these stories, all these stories - I don't know what to think.

[MOB21_K]
Maybe she thinks she can do what she likes, but Tommy, tell me, is it true?

[MOB21_M]
Is what true?

[MOB21_N]
These stories I hear. Is she really going to be a lawyer?

[MOB21_O]
Oh Tommy, the shame, the shame! You know, we Cortez's are a proud family.

[MOB21_P]
We would never allow a daughter of ours to become a lawyer. Please tell me it isn't so. I don't think I could take it.

[MOB21_Q]
Oh Colonel, I can assure you Mercedes is never going to become a lawyer. Don't worry about it.

[MOB21_R]
Oh thank you, Tommy. Tommy, thank you. The shame would be unbearable. She is a lady, not a parasite, you know.

[MOB21_S]
I know, colonel.

[MOB21_T]
Anyway, Tommy, you must excuse me, the new minister of the interior has arrived.

[MOB21_U]
Many years ago, I killed his father in a failed coup so I must be polite. Good day, amigo.

[MOB21_C]
Tommy, it is always a struggle here. Excuse the poor line, we have just had another failed coup.

[MOB21_D]
The people are the most demanding mistress of all.

[MOB21_E]
So far, we have had three revolutions and four coups since I return from Vice City.

[MOB21_F]
Luckily, I have been promoted each time.

[MOB21_J]
Maybe everyone is humiliating me.

[MOB21_L]
but tell me Tommy, is it true?

[MOB22_A]
Tommy, you are proving very useful, my friend.

[MOB22_B]
Thanks, Cortez. What about my deal?

[MOB22_C]
Tommy, I am working tirelessly on your behalf to ensue we get to the bottom of this trench of stinking lies and deceit,

[MOB22_D]
you have my word on that, but in the meantime,

[MOB22_E]
please accept the esteemed thanks of my people for your work on our behalf.

[MOB_25A]
Tommy, Thomas it's Cortez. Look, the French are giving me all kinds of trouble, amigo.

[MOB_25B]
Damn hypocrites. They spend a hundred years stealing from poor countries and they call me a thief!

[MOB_25C]
I am going to need your help as soon as possible, amigo.

[MOB_25D]
So please hurry, Tommy, I need you, all right? I hate the damn French.

[MOB_26A]
Hello, Tommy?

[MOB_26B]
Yeah?

[MOB_26C]
It's Baker. I just wanted to say I really enjoyed the show.

[MOB_26D]
Me and the boys want to thank you, and remind you,

[MOB_26E]
you got our respect. Good day. Keep riding hard, son.

[MOB_29A]
Hello, is this Mr. Tommy Vercetti?

[MOB_29B]
Yes.

[MOB_29C]
Well, I hear through the vine of grapes you the man when someone got a vermin infestation.

[MOB_29D]
Maybe...

[MOB_29E]
Well, I got a real vermin infestation. Haitians everywhere.

[MOB_29F]
My name is Umberto Robina and I want you to meet me at the Cafe Robina as soon as you can,

[MOB_29G]
'cause I tell you, these damn Haitians gone too far this time.

[MOB_29H]
Test

[MOB_30A]
Tommy, is Umberto Robina

[MOB_30B]
Hey, how's the cafe?

[MOB_30C]
Oh, wonderful. Incredible. Tommy, incredible. No wimps, Tommy, just real men, and the beautiful women!

[MOB_30D]
Anyway, I wanted to tell you, me and Papi, to us, you Cuban.

[MOB_30E]
You have proved yourself, man. You got big cojones.

[MOB_30F]
Well thank you, Umberto. Nobody's said that to me since I left jail. I'll see you around.

[MOB_33A]
Tommy, it's Phil, now cut out all the reminiscing crap and listen to me, you hear?

[MOB_33B]
Good. I got me some extra strength boomshine nearing fermentation time and I was wondering if you'd fancy having a shot.

[MOB_33C]
Seriously, Tommy, if you like a drink, or if you need to strip paint, this stuff'll make a man out of you.

[MOB_33D]
Sure did out of me, even though I can't see out of one eye. I'll be waiting for you, y'hear.

[MOB_34A]
Tommy, I really enjoyed working with you. Ain't had so much fun since the ridge in Nam, pal.

[MOB_34B]
Anyhows, you need anything, you call on me, you hear?

[MOB_34C]
I always remember those I served with,

[MOB_34D]
and I am sure I can help you out, you hear?

[MOB_35A]
Tommy, the wound is healing well. Funny thing is,

[MOB_35B]
I have fought in 6 battle zones and always walked away without a scratch, and now this!

[MOB_35C]
One armed Phil. Still, I got me a healthy selection of one handed fire power so I'll never be unarmed Phil, you hear.

[MOB_35D]
Any way son, cut out the sentimental crap and go buy yourself a drink, you hear!

[MOB_36A]
Tommy, it's Phil, I want to thank you for helping me out back there son,

[MOB_36B]
Damn Charlie, he'll always ambush you somewhere or other,

[MOB_36C]
Anyway the wound is healing well, and it means I'll no longer be defrauding the government on my disability check.

[MOB_40A]
Hey Tommy, it's Sonny. How's the sun tan?

[MOB_40B]
I ain't got no sun tan.

[MOB_40C]
Well, you ain't got my money, either, so I'm wondering to myself,

[MOB_40D]
what are you doing? So, tell me, Tommy, what are you doing?

[MOB_40E]
I'm looking for the money, Sonny. Don't worry.

[MOB_40F]
I am worrying, Tommy, that's my style,

[MOB_40G]
because I seem to have this problem in my life with unreliable people.

[MOB_40H]
Don't be an unreliable person, Tommy, please.

[MOB_40I]
Do us both a favor. I'm looking forward to hearing from you.

[MOB_41A]
Tommy, remember me?

[MOB_41B]
Hello Sonny.

[MOB_41C]
That's right, Sonny. We're old friends,

[MOB_41D]
You never write me, you never call. Don't you want to be friends no more?

[MOB_41E]
I've been busy trying to sort things out. You didn't give me a lot of support down here, Sonny.

[MOB_41F]
Oh, my fault is it? We'll I've heard you been busy all right.

[MOB_41G]
Busy killing drugs barons. Busy taking over.

[MOB_41H]
Don't forget about us, Tommy, 'cause I can assure you, I ain't forgotten about you.

[MOB_42A]
Tommy.

[MOB_42B]
Sonny.

[MOB_42C]
Obviously you are suffering from hearing problems, so I'll try again.

[MOB_42D]
Where's the goddamned money, where's the goddamned stuff, and where's my cut of your new action?

[MOB_42E]
You are making an idiot out of me, Tommy, and I'm not laughing yet.

[MOB_43A]
Tommy, Tommy, Tommy, I had Sonny on the phone, ok, are you with me?.

[MOB_43B]
I don't know about you, but there's something about a man threatening to murder my family

[MOB_43C]
which really scares the crap out of me. What are you going to do?

[MOB_43D]
Ken, take it easy.

[MOB_43E]
I AM calm, calm as a man can be when he's fearing for his life!

[MOB_43F]
Stay off the idiot fuel and look after yourself.

[MOB_43G]
No one's gonna take us out. I'll see you later.

[MOB_43H]
I am calm. Don't I sound calm? Must be impending death that is doing this to my voice.

[MOB45_A]
Tommy We gotta talk about stuff.

[MOB45_B]
What's the problem Lance?

[MOB45_C]
It's you, my friend, I feel you're not giving me a fair slice.

[MOB45_D]
And more than that, you been embarrassing me in front of the boys. I can't have that.

[MOB45_E]
Lance, it ain't like that. You've been making mistakes.

[MOB45_F]
Tommy, I'm not your message boy. I'm not your running boy.

[MOB45_G]
Lance, don't screw up, and we won't have any problems. I screw up, you can lay into me any time.

[MOB45_H]
Tommy, I've done everything for you, you treat me like a fool. Don't do that.

[MOB45_I]
Lance, I won't rip you off or stab you in the back, okay?

[MOB45_J]
Just take it easy. This is tough enough without you getting all emotional on me.

[MOB45_K]
Trust me. Do you hear me, do you hear me?

[MOB45_L]
I hear you, Tommy, but I can't take this much more.

[MOB45_M]
Lance, don't be like this. Now I'm warning you.

[MOB45_N]
Do you hear me? Just relax, take a few days off. Okay? I'll talk to you.

[MOB46_A]
Yo, Tommy! It's Lance.

[MOB46_B]
Yeah?

[MOB46_C]
Oh, nice to hear from you, Lance. Come on, man, be cool, be cool.

[MOB46_D]
I'm in the middle of something. What do you want?

[MOB46_E]
Nothing. Just to say, you know. Look Tommy, we can do this thing.

[MOB46_F]
You and me, no problem. You know what I mean?

[MOB46_G]
We're going to have to do it, 'cause otherwise, we're going to be dead, Lance.

[MOB46_H]
We're in too far now. But thanks for the call. I'll speak to you later.

[MOB_47A]

I gotta go.

[MOB_63A]
Tommy, it's Earnest. Earnest Kelly.

[MOB_63B]
How are you?

[MOB_63C]
I'm doing okay. I'll need a stick to walk, but I should be back at work soon enough.

[MOB_63D]
Good.

[MOB_63E]
I heard about Lance. What a little prick, eh?

[MOB_63F]
Yes.

[MOB_63G]
Never trust a man who walks the streets in his pajamas. That's what I say. Glad you killed him. I hope it was painful for the prick.

[MOB_63H]
I think it was. I just didn't think he was like that...

[MOB_63I]
Tommy, for a raging lunatic, you're pretty naive. I'll be back at work soon, teach you a thing or two about life, you hear.

[MOB_63J]
Take your time, Earnest. Look after yourself.

[MOB_16A]
Tommy, Paulo here, que pasa amigo?

[MOB_16B]
What do you want Paul? I don't want any fake label clothes.

[MOB_16C]
Very funny, mate, but you know I don't touch bent gear. Nah, I was just calling to see if I get a part in one your movies.

[MOB_16D]
Back in England I did a lot of blue stuff, mate. I'm packing more heat than you, my son.

[MOB_16E]
Paul, thanks for the offer, I'll bear it in mind.

[MOB_16F]
Seriously, don't forget about me, after all I done for you.

[MOB_16G]
That's what I'm trying to forget about.

[MOB_17A]
Tommy Vercetti, how's it going, Mr. big shot? I hear all these things about you, some kind of player in town, now eh...

[MOB_17B]
Paul, you're drunk.

[MOB_17C]
Nah, you stupid prat, I ain't drunk. I only had a couple and some treats, ain't been to bed for a couple of days, you know.

[MOB_17D]
Anyway, don't give me that. I ain't a mug. Who set you up in this town? Who? Me. That's who.

[MOB_17F]
Really?

[MOB_17G]
Don't give me that. Don't! I introduced you to people. I showed you the ropes, did a lot of stuff for you, and this is how you repay me.

[MOB_17H]
You ignore me. You won't give me a way in, after all I did for you! What do you think I am? A div or something?

[MOB_17I]
Paul, take it easy. I've been busy, don't be an idiot.

[MOB_17J]
I ain't no idiot, mush. That's what they said in borstal. Are you asking for trouble son, because you're going to get it!

[MOB_17K]
Tommy, mate. Please. You was my big hope! Please, don't laugh at me!

[MOB_17L]
Paul, get some sleep, seriously.

[MOB_73A]
Tommy, it's Steve.

[MOB_73B]
Hey, Steve.

[MOB_73C]
Hey indeed, genius. You're a marvel! I'm a marvel! They love us. We are re-writing the record books, pal.

[MOB_73D]
We are talking major awards here. Finally, I can put my dad in a home an tell him to shut up.

[MOB_73E]
Eeer, that's cool, Steve.

[MOB_73F]
Cool? It's hot, man. Hot. H. O. T. He never believed in me. Never thought I was an artist, and now I've made it.

[MOB_73G]
I'm the best damn skin flick director of all time, my friend. I just wanted to say, it's a pleasure to have met you.

[MOB_73H]
Thanks steve.

[MOB_73I]
I love you, baby. Don't go changing on me, you hear.

[BJM3_A:BANKJ3]
Things are starting to come together nicely here.

[BJM3_B:BANKJ3]
What's the plan, Tommy? Que pasa, amigo?

[BJM3_C:BANKJ3]
The plan is you keep doing that like a moron. Anyhow, we need a driver.

[BJM3_D:BANKJ3]
Tommy, I'll do it. I can drive.

[BJM3_E:BANKJ3]
You want Hilary, mister. Not some smart-talking law school chump.

[BJM3_F:BANKJ3]
Hilary's the real deal. You ain't never seen anyone drive so fast. I'll give him a call here.

[BJM3_G:BANKJ3]
Hey Hil, it's Phil. How's it going? No. don't talk. We'll reminisce later. You want to do me a favor?

[BJM3_H:BANKJ3]
I got me a guy from up north. No, no, I don't think he was in the service, but he wants a driver.

[BJM3_I:BANKJ3]
For a bit of action. Okay, I understand.

[BJM3_J:BANKJ3]
What'd he say?

[BJM3_K:BANKJ3]
Well, he'll do it, no problem. Well, there might be a little problem - see, he has abandonment issues.

[BJM3_L:BANKJ3]
Seems he won't work for anyone who can't beat him. Something to do with his momma.

[BJM3_M:BANKJ3]
Anyway, he wants to race you first, said he'd meet you outside..

[BJM3_2A:BANKJ3]
You Tommy? Of course you're Tommy, I mean,

[BJM3_2B:BANKJ3]
Why else would anyone want to speak to me?

[BJM3_2C:BANKJ3]
OK. Consider it this way -

[BJM3_2D:BANKJ3]
I'll drive for you IF, and only IF, you can drive properly.

[BJM3_2E:BANKJ3]
Leave me alone - and I'll never forgive you.

[BJM3_2:BANKJ3]
~r~Hilary is dead!

[BJM3_4:BANKJ3]
~g~You need a car to take part!

[BNK4_C:BANKJ4]
~w~What the hell are you smoking, man? This ain't no simple plan!

[BNK4_D:BANKJ4]
~w~Well, who needs a simple plan anyway?

[BNK4_E:BANKJ4]
~w~Take communism, now that was a simple plan. Didn't do Russia any favors, huh?

[BNK4_F:BANKJ4]
~w~Calm down, all right? With a team like this it's going to be no problem.

[BNK4_G:BANKJ4]
~w~We got Cam on safe. Phil? You and me will handle security, and Hilary'll drive the getaway car.

[BNK4_H:BANKJ4]
~w~Uh, heh heh, aren't you forgetting somebody? Somebody who helped you to no end in this town? Somebody who...

[BNK4_I:BANKJ4]
~w~Ken... Ken, that's right. Ken here, he washes the money for us and he keeps the drinks on ice.

[BNK4_J:BANKJ4]
~w~I don't understand what I am supposed to be doing here.

[BNK4_K:BANKJ4]
~w~Look, it's easy. Haven't you ever seen a movie?

[BNK4_L:BANKJ4]
~w~We walk into the bank, we wave the gun around, and leave very rich men.

Hey, watch the wheels, Tommy!

[BNK4_3B:BANKJ4]
Tommy, Hilary's taking up too much room!

[BNK4_3C:BANKJ4]
I am not!

[BNK4_3D:BANKJ4]

[BNK4_3E:BANKJ4]
Hey, shut up you two, or you can get out and walk.

[BNK4_3F:BANKJ4]
Yeah - HILARY.

[BNK4_3I:BANKJ4]
For god's sake, Phil, stop waving that thing around!

[BNK4_3J:BANKJ4]
Yeah, you'll have somebody's eye out!

[BNK4_3M:BANKJ4]
The car's ruined. RUINED!

[BNK4_3O:BANKJ4]
You cling to an illusion of permanence.

[BNK4_3P:BANKJ4]
What?

[BNK4_3Q:BANKJ4]
You think all things will last.

[BNK4_3R:BANKJ4]
Youth, loved ones, pizza,

[BNK4_3S:BANKJ4]
All will pass or end and you must accept that.

[BNK4_3T:BANKJ4]
You're right. Thanks, Cam.

[BNK4_3U:BANKJ4]
Don't mention it.

[BNK4_3V:BANKJ4]
Hey Tommy, why have we stopped?

[BNK4_4A:BANKJ4]

This could take hours to crack,

[BK4_12C:BANKJ4]
Or five minutes if you could find the manager.

[BNK4_13:BANKJ4]
I'll go find where he's holed up.

[BK4_14A:BANKJ4]
Phil, things still sweet?

[BNK4_15:BANKJ4]
Sure. Everything's reeaal quiet.

[BNK4_16:BANKJ4]
You - you're coming with me!

[BNK4_17:BANKJ4]
Ok! Ok! Just don't shoot!

[BNK4_18:BANKJ4]
I SAID NOBODY MOVE!

[BK4_19A:BANKJ4]
It's on a time lock,

[BK4_19B:BANKJ4]
You might as well give up now!

[BK4_20A:BANKJ4]
Hell, I can bypass the time lock,

[BK4_20B:BANKJ4]
Then we just need your key code and we're good!

[BNK4_21:BANKJ4]
Stay here. You try anything and you're dead.

[BNK422A:BANKJ4]
Cam, how long?

[BK4_23A:BANKJ4]
Give me 5 minutes!

[BK4_24A:BANKJ4]
I'm gonna check on Phil, I'll be right back.

[BK4_24B:BANKJ4]
I told you not to touch that alarm!

[BNK4_25:BANKJ4]
The SWAT team will be here any minute!

You do a good job - you work for me now.

As I said, amigo, you work for me now. Shut up. Some Judas has betrayed me.

I like fish. I love fish.

[FIN1_04:FINALE]
I love them as pets in bowls, or as food on a plate,

[FIN1_05:FINALE]
but as much as I love em, I don't want to sleep with them.

[FIN1_06:FINALE]
Okay, but right now your Italian brothers are coming from up there to fit me with some cement shoes, and I...

[FIN1_07:FINALE]
Shut up Ken. Sit down.

[FIN1_08:FINALE]
Lance, what the hell's going on?

[FIN1_09:FINALE]
It's your friends up north Tommy. They ain't too happy you capped their man.

[FIN1_10:FINALE]
They're coming down to see the business today.

[FIN1_11:FINALE]
They took longer than I thought...

[FIN1_12:FINALE]
Guys, we gotta make this final we gotta leave no doubt that this is my operation. Mine!

[FIN1_13:FINALE]
Ken, you get the first run of counterfeit cash and put three mil in briefcases.

[FIN1_14:FINALE]
Lance, you get the guys together...

[FIN2_01:FINALE]
Tommy!

[FIN2_02:FINALE]
What? No big hugs for your old buddy?

[FIN2_03:FINALE]
I've had fifteen years out of the loop,

[FIN2_04:FINALE]
I'm a bit rusty on family etiquette.

[FIN2_05:FINALE]
Always angry, eh Tommy.

[FIN2_06:FINALE]
Didn't I say your temper would get you into trouble, huh?

[FIN2_07:FINALE]
There's three mil in the cases...

[FIN2_08:FINALE]
How many was it? Ten? No, eleven men.

[FIN2_09:FINALE]
That's how you get to be called the Harwood Butcher! Heh-heh-heh!

[FIN2_10:FINALE]
You sent me to kill one man, ONE MAN. They knew I was coming Sonny...

[FIN2_11:FINALE]
Tommy, Tommy, watch your tone.

[FIN2_12:FINALE]
Anyone would think you blame me for that unfortunate set of circumstances.

[FIN2_13:FINALE]
Just take the money...

[FIN2_14:FINALE]
Get the damn cash.

[FIN2_15:FINALE]
You know, Tommy? I did what I could for you, I pulled strings, called in favors.

[FIN2_16:FINALE]
I was your friend, Tommy. I hoped you'd see sense, see what's good for business.

[FIN2_17:FINALE]
I trusted you, Tommy, and you disappointed me.

[FIN2_18:FINALE]
But at least someone in your chicken shit organization knows how to do business,

[FIN2_19:FINALE]
Isn't that right, Lance?

[FIN2_20:FINALE]
I'm sorry Tommy. This is Vice City. This is business.

[FIN2_21:FINALE]
You sold us out...

No. I sold YOU out, Tommy, I sold YOU out.

[FIN2_23:FINALE]
The real cash is upstairs in the safe.

[FIN2_24:FINALE]
Tommy, what was the big plan?

[FIN2_25:FINALE]
You think I'd just take the fake cash?

[FIN2_26:FINALE]
Save face and run away with my tail between my legs?!

[FIN2_27:FINALE]
No.

[FIN2_28:FINALE]
I just wanted to piss you off before I kill you.

What does it look like?

[FIN3_04:FINALE]
It looks like you ruined your suit!

[FIN3_05:FINALE]
and Tommy, that was a beautiful suit! Tommy, what on earth happened?

[FIN3_06:FINALE]
I had a disagreement with a business associate, you know how it is.

[FIN3_07:FINALE]
Tommy, I have a disagreement, I send them an angry letter.

[FIN3_08:FINALE]
Maybe I pee in their mailbox. I don't start World War III.

[FIN3_09:FINALE]
You know, maybe you should speak to my shrink...

[FIN3_10:FINALE]
That stupid prick, Lance...

[FIN3_11:FINALE]
Tommy. I never liked that guy, okay?

[FIN3_12:FINALE]
He's neurotic, he's insecure, he's self-centered - the guy's an asshole!

[FIN3_13:FINALE]
I'm glad you took him out!

[FIN3_14:FINALE]
I don't think we're gonna be getting any more heat from up north either...

[FIN3_15:FINALE]
...'cause there ain't no 'up north', anymore.

[FIN3_16:FINALE]
It's all down south now.

[FIN3_17:FINALE]
Wait, does that mean what I think it means..? Tommy, baby!

[FIN3_18:FINALE]
What do you think it means?

[FIN3_19:FINALE]
That we're in charge... I mean, that you're in charge. Oh, Tommy!

[FIN3_20:FINALE]
You know, Ken. I think this could be the beginning of a beautiful business relationship....

[FIN3_21:FINALE]
After all, you're a conniving, backstabbing, two-bit thief

[FIN3_22:FINALE]

The fishermen are in the throes of passion when this giant shark comes in -

[POR2_G:PORN2]
What'd I say about the giant shark?

[POR2_H:PORN2]
I said, 'NO GIANT SHARK', alright?

[POR2_I:PORN2]
Just keep the cameras pointed at the poontang!

[POR2_J:PORN2]
Ok ok, hey Tommy, a guy's gotta try, right?

[POR2_K:PORN2]
Get those flyers printed up?

[POR2_L:PORN2]
Yeah, but nobody's gonna let us distribute those things, I mean

[POR2_M:PORN2]
They're just too, uh, they're unimaginative.

[POR2_N:PORN2]
You don't worry about that.

[POR2_O:PORN2]
I've got my own ideas for distribution.

[POR2_P:PORN2]
O.K. Hey, Candy, uh - in my trailer.

[POR3_D:PORN3]
our hero finds himself unable to think of anything but this huge phallic mountain -

[POR3_I:PORN3]
You mentioned something about some legal problem on the phone?

[POR3_J:PORN3]
Congressman Alex Shrub has jumped on the pre-election bandwagon, he's going after the puritan vote.

[POR3_K:PORN3]
Rumors are he's gonna support measures to restrict, shall we say,

[POR3_L:PORN3]
the more fleshy aspects of this nation's great entertainment industry.

[POR3_M:PORN3]
Great.

You got a camera?

[POR3_X:PORN3]

[RBM1_N:ROCK1]
I'm too crafty for that, sunshine!

[RBM1_O:ROCK1]
You see, the thing is, Tom, the boys need some help.

[RBM1_P:ROCK1]
They ain't too connected here, they don't have the old 'how's your father?'

[RBM1_Q:ROCK1]
We need some drugs, pal!

[RBM1_R:ROCK1]
Gonna get on the old Love Fist fury, you know?!

[RBM1_S:ROCK1]

[RBM1_V:ROCK1]
Love Juice?

[RBM1_W:ROCK1]
Aye, two parts boomshine, 1 part trumpet, 5 fizz bombs and a liter of petrol.

[RBM1_X:ROCK1]
Can you help us out, pal?

[RBM1_Y:ROCK1]
Aw, it would really mean a lot to the boys.

[RBM1_Z:ROCK1]
You can do that for the boys, right?

[RBM1_7:ROCK1]

Bad vibes, Tommy....

[RBM2_E:ROCK2]
There's this cat, we hardly know him, but he knows us.

[RBM2_F:ROCK2]
Like this cat. Knows all about us.

[RBM2_G:ROCK2]

[RBM2_P:ROCK2]
We got a signing in two hours and I think...

[RBM2_Q:ROCK2]
And the boys think the stalker's gonna try some monkey business there.

[RBM2_1:ROCK2]

Shut up ye fool. Just 'cause Jezz bangs sheep.

[RBM2_R:ROCK2]
Oi shut it!

[RBM2_D:ROCK2]
Aye, I'm not joking, it's heavy stuff man, heavy you know?

[RBM2_J:ROCK2]
It's a love rocket thing, you know?

{=================================== MISSION TABLE ROCK3 ===================================}

[RBM3_A:ROCK3]

[RBM3_C:ROCK3]
That psycho won't leave Love Fist alone!

[RBM3_D:ROCK3]
You didnae kill him man. And now he's back.

[RBM3_E:ROCK3]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, and the thing is...

[RBM3_F:ROCK3]
The thing is, we need someone to drive the limo we can trust,

[RBM3_G:ROCK3]
cause that nutter keeps making threats!

[RBM3_I:ROCK3]
We're all bricking ourselves, man.

[RBM3_J:ROCK3]
Okay guys, calm down, I'll handle this.

[RBM3_K:ROCK3]
Normally I wouldn't busy myself with driving around a bunch of drunken Scottish bisexuals,

[RBM3_L:ROCK3]
but, in your case I'll make an exception.

[RBM3_4:ROCK3]
~r~You've killed Love Fist!

[RBM3_6:ROCK3]
DETONATION:

[RBM3_1:ROCK3]
~g~Drive Love Fist to the venue.

[RBM3_2:ROCK3]
While the bomb is armed if you try to leave the car it will explode...

[RBM3_3:ROCK3]
If the detonation bar completely fills the bomb will explode.

[RBM3_8:ROCK3]
The faster you drive the lower the detonation bar will go.

[RBM3_7:ROCK3]
~g~BOMB DEFUSED!

[ROK3_62:ROCK3]
so we thought we'd show you our Temple of Rock -

[ROK3_63:ROCK3]
Get a feel for that Love Fist fury!

[ROK3_64:ROCK3]
Listen to yourself, man. It's papier-mache and gaffa tape.

[ROK3_65:ROCK3]
Hey, to the kids, it's a temple and we are the priests!

[ROK3_66:ROCK3]
Aye, well, if the kids like their priests half cut and tone deaf,

[ROK3_67:ROCK3]
who am I to argue?

[ROK3_68:ROCK3]
Oh geez, the tape's getting chewed again.

[ROK3_69:ROCK3]
At this rate, we'll never get to play live.

[ROK3_70:ROCK3]
Oohh shite! My bowels...

[ROK3_73:ROCK3]
Jezz is running the tape,

[RBM3_9:ROCK3]
If you are stopped or drive slowly the detonation bar will increase.

[RBM3_H:ROCK3]
I'm shitin' masel' man. I need ma ma!

[ROK3_71:ROCK3]
We gotta get on with it - thanks again Tommy, Know what I am saying, nice one, bye!

[ROK3_1:ROCK3]
At last man, time for a well earned drink. The venue's just a hundred yards down the road.

[ROK3_2:ROCK3]
Better make it a large one then. Hey Tommy, change the tunes, man.

[ROK3_3:ROCK3]
I get confused if my head ain't banging. Ah look, what's this? Hey Tommy, stick this tape on.

[ROK3_4:ROCK3]
Love Fist. Your time polluting the airwaves is over. I gave you the chance to be friends.

[ROK3_5:ROCK3]
Now, I'm giving you the chance to die. Try to slow down and your limousine will explode, along with your BIG, HAIRY ARSES!

[ROK3_6:ROCK3]
Tommy pal, you gotta save the band! I'm getting bored of this. Just keep the pedal to the metal!!

[ROK3_7:ROCK3]
We gotta find the bomb! Can't we just drive around all day? Aye, we've got plenty to drink..

[ROK3_8:ROCK3]
Won't the bomb not be in the engine? We'll have to stop to get it. We're all going to die! I'm gonna get drunk!

[ROK3_9:ROCK3]
Hey, there's a queue here pal! The answer ain't in the drinks cabinet! Get out of my way!

[ROK3_10:ROCK3]
Hey, the vodka bottle's got wires coming out of it! That's not vodka, that's BOOMSHINE!

[ROK3_11:ROCK3]
WAAAAAAGGGHHHH!!!! And it's wired to blow!! WAAAAAAAAAAAAGGGHHHHHHHH!!!!

[ROK3_12:ROCK3]
They always said the drink would kill me. I've seen this on the telly. you gotta pull out one of the wires. Which wire? I don't know, man.

[ROK3_13:ROCK3]
I don't have a clue. Willy, say something. I'm gonna play bass in hell.

[ROK3_14:ROCK3]
Tommy man, keep driving fast, pal. Somebody do something. Aye, clever!

[ROK3_15:ROCK3]
'Somebody do something', what kind of crap is that, I've seen braver girls. Okay tough guy, you do something.

[ROK3_16:ROCK3]
Look, man, I play a musical instrument I don't have a clue about bomb disposal. Willy could just suck the boomshine out with a straw.

[ROK3_17:ROCK3]
Aye, I've heard that your good at that kind of thing. Hey, I was off my tits that night, as well you know!

[ROK3_18:ROCK3]
Just pass Willy a straw! A straw?!?! This is the Love Fist Tour Bus!

[ROK3_19:ROCK3]
Where am I gonna get a straw from, know wot I mean? Which wire, Tommy? The green one. There isn't a green one.

[ROK3_20:ROCK3]
Or is this one green? Any of these wires look green to you?

[ROK3_21:ROCK3]
Oh no! Death's on the cards! Everything looks green! I should have dumped you lot when I had the chance man.

[ROK3_22:ROCK3]
Glory seeker. Capitalist. I've been carrying you for years. Shut up. You're a muppit.

[ROK3_23:ROCK3]
A big screaming girl. Yeah. Shut up and pull a wire. Which wire? This one..

[ROK3_24:ROCK3]
NO! Man, we're okay. We ain't been blown up, pal.

[ROK3_25:ROCK3]
Tommy, man, nice one. Rock and roll, man. Ain't we got a gig to go to?

[ROK3_26:ROCK3]
A racket to make? Groupies to abuse? LOVE FIST!

[ROK3_27:ROCK3]
Have you finished with that bottle?

{=================================== MISSION TABLE SERG1 ===================================}

[TEX1_A:SERG1]
Come in and park yourself on the hide, son.

[TEX1_B:SERG1]
Hell, my daddy used to say, never look a gift horse in the mouth, and by golly, he never did.

[TEX1_C:SERG1]
Would you like a drop of the old Kentucky?

[TEX1_D:SERG1]
No thanks.

[TEX1_E:SERG1]
A clean thinker! I like that.

[TEX1_F:SERG1]
Now, the property business isn't all about high-falootin' paper pushing.

[TEX1_G:SERG1]
It's about dirt! And the will to claim that dirt! You with me, son?

[TEX1_H:SERG1]
Oh yeah.

[TEX1_K:SERG1]
Persuasion's my forte.

[TEX1_L:SERG1]
Yeh, he'll be down at the country club, down on the golf course.

[TEX1_M:SERG1]
They don't allow guns, so his bodyguards won't be packing lawgivers.

[TEX1_N:SERG1]
Go beat eight tons of crap out of him.

[TEX1_O:SERG1]
Here now - I got you a membership, and boy you're going to need more appropriate clothing.

Who's this guy? Boys, deal with him.

[TEX1_6:SERG1]
Nice ass baby!

[TEX1_7:SERG1]
Is this me?

[TEX1_I:SERG1]
Well, I need some tenacious bastard to let go of some dirt,

[TEX1_J:SERG1]
and you look to me like the kind of guy to persuade him.

[TEX1_0:SERG1]
~g~The target is at the driving range enjoying a game of golf. Make sure it's his last.

[TEX1_8:SERG1]

[TEX2_C:SERG2]
Yeh...uh...

[TEX2_D:SERG2]
Donald, you just shut up and listen, and you might learn something.

[TEX2_E:SERG2]
Now, nothing brings down real estate prices quicker than a good old-fashioned gang war -

[TEX2_F:SERG2]
'cept maybe a disaster, like a biblical plague or something,

[TEX2_G:SERG2]
but, that may be going too far in this case.

[TEX2_H:SERG2]
You getting this down, you four-eyed prick?

[TEX2_I:SERG2]
Now recently a Haitian gang lord died. Apparently the Cubans did it, nobody's certain.

[TEX2_J:SERG2]
But let's make them certain! You disguise yourself as a Cuban hombre,

[TEX2_K:SERG2]
and head on down to crash that funeral. Mix it up, and then high tail it.

[TEX2_L:SERG2]
You getting this down, Donald?

[TEX2_M:SERG2]
Well, that ought to put the coyote in the chicken coop, huh?

[TEX2_N:SERG2]
And then we'll just sit back, and watch the prices tumble.

[TEXEXIT:SERG2]
~g~Now get out of Little Haiti!
